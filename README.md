# ADmyBRAND AI Suite

A modern, AI-powered marketing intelligence platform built with React and TypeScript.

# AI Assistance in Project Development
This project’s foundational layout was initially created using Bolt AI, a powerful AI assistant that accelerated the scaffolding process. Building upon that, I used GitHub Copilot extensively to enhance the UI, improve the codebase, and implement complex features efficiently.

The modal and user input forms were crafted manually to ensure precise control over user experience and data collection, delivering elegant, responsive, and accessible components tailored for this SaaS application.

   npm run dev
   ```

## Notes

- The entry point is `src/main.tsx`, which renders `App.tsx` into the `#root` element in `index.html`.
- All UI and logic are implemented as React components.
- Styling is handled via `index.css` (commonly with Tailwind CSS or your preferred framework).
- The project is modular and easy to extend with new features or sections.
